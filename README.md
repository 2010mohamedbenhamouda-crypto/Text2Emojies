# Text2Emojies
This project is a simple web application that converts text into emojis to make messages more fun and expressive. It is developed by one student as a learning project to practice programming and web development skills. In the future, the project will be improved by adding more emojis, better text transformations, and a cleaner user interface.
# HTML 
To guarantee a user-friendly interface, I organized the page in HTML in a clear and sensitive manner. There are buttons to begin the transformation or remove the content, a text area where the user can write their message, and a dropdown menu to select the transformation style. Without reloading the page, the modified text is shown instantly in the results box. Because each element has a unique ID, JavaScript can quickly obtain them and control interactions. The page is readable, effective
# CSS 
The site's overall visual identity is provided by the CSS, which gives it a contemporary, gloomy vibe. In order to make the interface both understandable and fashionable, I utilized contrasting colors like pink, dark gray, and black. The experience is made more seamless and pleasurable by subtle animations, hover effects, and transitions. For convenience of usage, results, buttons, and text fields are centered and spaced appropriately. The site is both aesthetically beautiful and useful because of the uniform design throughout the page and the obvious hierarchy between the titles, content, and interactions.
#Java Script
The routines I wrote change the text based on the mode that the user has selected. Every function has a distinct purpose, such as adding emojis, changing the capitalization, inverting the text, or applying special effects to letters. This division maintains the code's organization and readability. The appropriate function is automatically run and returns the updated text when the user presses the button. This framework makes it simple to introduce new styles without disrupting the program as a whole.
